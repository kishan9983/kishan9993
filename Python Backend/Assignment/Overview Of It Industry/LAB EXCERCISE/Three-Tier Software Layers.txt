1. Presentation Layer (User Interface Layer)

Functionality:

The presentation layer interacts with the user.

It displays the user interface (UI) of the library system on a web browser or mobile app.

Users can:

Search for books

View available books

Borrow or return books

Update account information

Technologies:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frontend frameworks (React, Angular)

Example:

A user enters “Data Structures” in the search bar → the presentation layer collects this input and sends it to the business logic layer.

2. Business Logic Layer (Application Layer)

Functionality:

The business logic layer processes user requests and enforces rules.

It handles:

Validating user input (e.g., check if a book is available)

Calculating overdue fines

Managing borrowing limits

Processing transactions

Technologies:

Server-side languages: PHP, Python (Django/Flask), Java (Spring), Node.js

Example:

When a user requests to borrow a book, the business logic checks if the book is available, verifies the user’s borrowing limit, and then updates the database.

3. Data Access Layer (Database Layer)

Functionality:

The data access layer manages storage and retrieval of data.

Stores information like:

Book details (title, author, availability)

User accounts

Borrowing history

Handles queries, inserts, updates, and deletes.

Technologies:

Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

SQL queries or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools

Example:

The business logic requests the availability of a book → the data layer queries the database → returns the result to the business layer → displayed to the user by the presentation layer.
